# Frontend technical exercise


The goal of this exercise is to give us an idea of how you solve frontend
engineering problems. Don't worry if the tools bundled in this project scaffold
aren't in your everyday toolbox. We're primarily evaluating:

- Your ability to write idiomatic JavaScript.
- Your approach to breaking down user interfaces into components.
- Your comfort level with making API requests and working with responses.

## Project requirements

Build a single page React application using the provided skeleton which allows a user to:

- [ ] List all StarWars films showing **title** and **release date** and link
    to list all characters in the film
- [ ] Each item in the characters list should link to a character profile
- [ ] Arrange the available character info, employing basic rules of
  - information hierachy
  - contrast
  - typography
  - color

For data, you can use the [SWAPI REST API](https://swapi.co/documentation) or
bonus points for using the new [SWAPI GraphQL
API](http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/) and
[Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/).

Check out [the setup instructions](setup.md) for a guide to getting started
with this project scaffold.
